# Road Accident Severity Prediction App üöß

# Description:
This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments for master's research work.
The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20.
All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally, it has 31 features
and **12316 instances** of the accident. Then it is preprocessed for identification of major causes
of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.

# Problem Statement:
The target feature is **Accident_severity** which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this
variable based on the other **31 features** step-by-step by going through each day's task. Your metric
for evaluation will be **f1-score**.

I followed these steps to complete the project.
